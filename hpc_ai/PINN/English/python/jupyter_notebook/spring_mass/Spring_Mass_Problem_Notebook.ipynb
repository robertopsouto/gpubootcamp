In an inverse problem, we start with a set of observations and then use those observations to calculate the causal factors that produced them. To demonstrate this concept we will solve the same spring mass system in an inverse setting. Specifically, we will assume that the data for the displacements of the 3 masses $x_1, x_2 \\text{ and } x_3$ is available to us through analytical solution and the first mass ($m_1$) and the last spring coefficient ($k_4$) is unknown. We will use the neural network to assimilate the displacements from the analytical solution and use it to invert out the unknown quantites from ODEs."

Setting `'x_1', 'x_2', 'x_3'` as input values from analytical data, we are essentially making the network assimilate the analytical distribution of these variables in the selected domain. Setting `'ode_x1', 'ode_x2', 'ode_x3'` equal to 0, we will also inform the network to satisfy the ODE losses at those sampled points. Now, assuming that we also know the initial conditions of the solution, except the `'m_1'` and `'k_4'`, all the variables in these ODEs are known. Thus the network can use this information to invert out the unknowns. The below code shows the data preparation step."
