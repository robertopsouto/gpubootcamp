We will embed the physics of the problem in the the neural networks and in such setting, we can use them to approximate the solution to a given differential equation and boundary condition without any training data from other solvers. More specifically, the neural network will be trained to minimize a loss function which is formed using the differential equation and the boundary conditions. If the network is able to minimize this loss then it will in effect solve the given differential equation.

This was initially proposed in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02382) published by Sun et al. This allows us significant computational advantage, as one can now use PINNs to solve for multiple designs/cases in a single training. Once the training is complete, it is possible to run inference on several geometry/physical parameter combinations as a post-processing step, without solving the forward problem again.\n",

To run the model in evaluation mode (i.e. without training), you just need to [modify the config file](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/text/features/configuration.html#run-modes).  \n",
