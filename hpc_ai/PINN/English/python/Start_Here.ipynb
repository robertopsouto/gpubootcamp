        "3. [Solving transient problems and inverse problems](jupyter_notebook/spring_mass/Spring_Mass_Problem_Notebook.ipynb) : In this tutorial we will see how to solve the transient problems over small time intervals easily by treating time as a continuous variable. We will also cover how to solve inverse problems.\n",
