We will embed the physics of the problem in the the neural networks and in such setting, we can use them to approximate the solution to a given differential equation and boundary condition without any training data from other solvers. More specifically, the neural network will be trained to minimize a loss function which is formed using the differential equation and the boundary conditions. If the network is able to minimize this loss then it will in effect solve the given differential equation.

For this physics-driven problem, these constraints are the boundary conditions and equation residuals. The goal is to satisfy the boundary conditions exactly, and ideally have the PDE residuals to go 0. These constraints can be specified within Modulus using classes like `PointwiseBoundaryConstrant` and `PointwiseInteriorConstraint`. A L2 loss (defult and can be modified) is then constructed from these constraints which is used by the optimizer to minimize on. Specifying the constraints in this fashion is called soft-constraints.  \n",

        "As we discussed in the introductory notebook, one important advantage of a PINN solver over traditional numerical methods is its ability to solve parameterized geometries and PDEs. This was initially proposed in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02382) published by Sun et al. This allows us significant computational advantage, as one can now use PINNs to solve for multiple designs/cases in a single training. Once the training is complete, it is possible to run inference on several geometry/physical parameter combinations as a post-processing step, without solving the forward problem again.\n",
        "\n",
        "To demonstrate the concept, we will train the same 1d diffusion problem, but now by parameterizing the conductivity of the first bar in the range (5, 25). Once the training is complete, we can obtain the results for any conductivity value in that range saving us the time to train multiple models."

Since earlier while defining the equations, we already defined the constants and coefficients of the PDE to be either numerical values or strings, this will allow us to paramterize `D1` by passing it as a string while calling the equations and making the neural network. Now let's start by creating the paramterized train domain. We will skip the parts that are common to the previous section and only discuss the changes. The complete script can be referred in [`diffusion_bar_parameterized.py`](../../source_code/diffusion_1d/diffusion_bar_parameterized.py)."
